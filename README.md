# Project Overview

In this project, I was given a real-world property dataset and a set of questions that needed to be answered using SQL.

The dataset contains property listings similar to Property24 real estate data, including information such as:

Province

City

Property price

Bedrooms

Bathrooms

Parking

Floor size

Monthly repayment

Income requirements

The objective of this project was to use SQL to explore the dataset and answer business related questions through structured queries.

This project helped me practice writing SQL queries against real data instead of just theory.

# Project Objective

### The goal was to:

Load the dataset into SQL Server

Analyze the data using SQL queries

Answer structured questions

Extract meaningful insights from raw property data

Instead of designing the database from scratch, this project focused on data analysis using SQL.

# Tools Used

Microsoft SQL Server

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)


## SQL Concepts Practiced

Through answering the questions, I practiced:

SELECT statements

WHERE filtering

ORDER BY sorting

DISTINCT values

TOP clause

Aggregate functions (AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT)

GROUP BY

# Types of Questions Answered

#### Some examples of the types of analysis performed:

Displaying all properties

Filtering properties by province

Finding the most expensive properties

Identifying affordable housing areas

Calculating average property prices per province

Determining minimum income required for high-value properties

Comparing cities based on price trends

These questions helped simulate real-world business analysis scenarios.

# What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:

#### How to Analyze Real-World Data

##### How to Think Like a Data Analyst
Instead of just writing queries, I learned how to:

Interpret business questions

Translate them into SQL logic

##### Writing Clean and Structured SQL

I practiced:

Writing readable SQL

Adding comments

Structuring queries properly

#### Extracting Insights from Raw Data

I learned how to use SQL not just to retrieve data, but to generate insights that answer business questions.

# Key Takeaway

This project strengthened my ability to:

Work with structured datasets

Write analytical SQL queries

Transform business questions into technical solutions

Interpret query results meaningfully

It helped bridge the gap between theoretical SQL knowledge and practical data analysis.
